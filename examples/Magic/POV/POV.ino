  POV (Persistence of Vision)
  
  With POV, persistence of vision, you can take eg a bike wheel
  and make it into a display with just a few LEDs. Check out 
  this video to see what we mean: 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TvGvVWS3IE
  
  In this project you will make one of these displays yourself. 
  Wave it with long strokes or even hold it while running to 
  display a text, a statement or a picture. The effect is most 
  visible in a dark place so if youâ€™re running, make sure not 
  to run in to a tree or a friend.
