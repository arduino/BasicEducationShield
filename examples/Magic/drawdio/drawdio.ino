  Drawdio

  Draw audio with drawdio. You might think that this pen is magic,
  and it might just be. Drawdio turns (almost) everything that is
  conductive into an instrument. You can either make music by
  drawing a picture or by touching the tip of it to different
  conductive things around you.
