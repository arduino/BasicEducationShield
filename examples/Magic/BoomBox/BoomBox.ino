  Boom Box
  
  This is your first step towards theese kinds of skills:

  The boom box is a small sample player you can use to make music, 
  or just random sound. It comes with three prerecorded samples 
  but we probably donâ€™t have the same creative cleverness when it
  comes to recording as you do so you should definitely record your 
  own samples too!
