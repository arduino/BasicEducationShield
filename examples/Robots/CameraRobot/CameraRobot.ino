/*
  Camera Robot
  
  Spy on your cat with this robot camera. Mount the camera robot and
  control it with a small joystick. You can run everything from the
  computer and when you see your cat doing something suspicious, 
  take a picture! 
  
  You need to run the processing sketch included in the sketch folder
  to be able to take photos with a webcam connected to your computer.
