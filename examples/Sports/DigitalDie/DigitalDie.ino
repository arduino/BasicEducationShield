  Digital Die
  
  Use this digital die next time you play a board game. 

  You "throw" the die by shaking a tilt sensor. The LEDs 
  will show different numbers, waiting a longer and longer 
  time for each number,  until it finally stops. Don't be 
  too fast to cheer believing it stopped on your desired 
  number or you might get disappointed ...
