  Ultrasonic Sensor
  An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the distance to the 
  closest object in front of the sensor. It uses ultrasound, 
  sound with a frequency higher than humans can hear. As you 
  probably know sound can reflect from surfaces creating an 
  echo. This echo is what the sensor uses to estimate the 
  distance. The sensors sends out a burst of ultrasound and 
  then waits for the echo. By knowing the speed of sound and 
  the time between the burst and the detection we can  
  calculate the distance. The shorter time it takes to detect 
  the echo, the closer the object is.
