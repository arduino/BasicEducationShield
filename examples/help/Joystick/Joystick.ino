/*	Joystick
*       The joystick is one component but uses two analog sensors and 
*       gives you two values. One x value and one y value. The value 
*       for each direction is zero if itâ€™s in the middle, -1 on one side 
*       and 1 on the other side. 
*
*	The joystick returns the position it is being pushed to.
*       It returns two values, one X value and one Y value. That is the
*       position on the X axis (left to right) and the position on the
*       Y axis (top to bottom).Each value can be -1, 0 or 1 where 0 is
*       the middle position. E.g. x=-1 and y=1 means that the joysticks
*       position is left top, x=0 and y=-1 means that the position is
*       middle bottom.
