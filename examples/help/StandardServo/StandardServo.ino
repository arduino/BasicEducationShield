  StandardServo
  
  180ยบ standard servos are a type of motor which have a limited 
  rotation angle. It has precise control over the angle of rotation.
  
  The ones provided for Basic Education Shield projects are 
  microservos. Microservos behave the same as a standard servo, 
  but are slimmer in size and exert less turning power.
