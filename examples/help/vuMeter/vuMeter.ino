  VU-Meter
  VU-Meter is a few LEDs grouped together into a line.
  
  This library has some features that makes it easy to control 
  several LEDs. Functions to use are:
  
      clear() - turns all LEDs off.
      on(LEDindex) - turns one LED on
      off(LEDindex) - turns one LED off
      scrollRight(speed, startIndex) - one LED light up at a time from left to right
      scrollLeft(speed, startIndex) - one LED light up at a time from right to left
      blink(LEDindex,speed, times) - one LED blinks
      blinkAll(speed, times) - all LEDs blink
      fillFrom(startIndex, stopIndex) - turns LEDs from startIndex to stopIndex on
      fill(numberOfLEDs) - turns LEDs on from first to numberOfLEDs
