/*	CapacitiveSwitch Test
*
*	When making use of sensor readings from CapacitiveSwitch,
*	This sketch helps you decide the threshold by showing
*	capacitive values of different materials.
*
*	Just touch the objects you're going to experiment with,
*	take note of the biggest and smallest values. In your
*	project code, use these values to map to your desired
*	outcome.
*
*	It can also be used for adjusting the threshold when using
*	capacitive sensor as a button.
