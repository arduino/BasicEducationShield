/*	ContinuousServo
*
*	Continuous servo looks the same as a standard servo, but its
*	capable of rotating continuous like a normal motor. You can not
*	control which angle itÂ´s pointing to, but you can specify how
*	fast it spins, and which direction it spins.
*
*       To control two servos as wheels on a vehicle please see the 
*       example Wheels in the help folder.
